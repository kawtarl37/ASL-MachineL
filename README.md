# ASL-MachineL
The aim of this project is to develop a high performance Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to identify American Sign Language(ASL) using a collection of images of characters from the ALS.
Each english character in ASL is represented by a nonverbal fingerspelled hand gesture.The model will recognise these gestures from the dataset images and predict the english language alphabet that ASL characters represent.
